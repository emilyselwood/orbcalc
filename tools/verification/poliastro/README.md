# Poliastro verification script

This is a simple script to verify that the output generated by orbcalc is the same as that generated by poliastro

It simply runs through a few minor planet orbits and propagates them forward for a year writing out a file with each day.

To run:

```
conda create -n poliver python=3.6
source activate poliver
conda install poliastro --channel conda-forge

python verification.py
```

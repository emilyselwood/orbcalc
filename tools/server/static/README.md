# OrbViewer

This is the repo housing [OrbViewer](https://parsecsreach.com/orbviwer)

The canonical copy of this repo lives as a tool in [OrbCalc](https://github.com/wselwood/orbcalc)

This part is the static assets that should be enough to host the basic part of the site.
In the directory above there is a go tool that will generate the required datafiles and host the site locally when you want to test things.

# orbcalc

A library to do orbital mechanics in go

Currently very basic and work in progress, DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO WORK YET.

Current Example in main.go which reads in the MPC orbit file propogates them forward by one day and then writes the vectors to a file

There is a lot still to do:

* Reference frame transformations.
* Verification of algorithms.
* Benchmarking
* Documentation

In progress:

* Propagation of orbits.

# orbcalc

A library to do orbital mechanics in go

Currently very basic and work in progress, DO NOT THIS TO WORK YET.

Current Example in main.go which reads in the MPC orbit file and converts the orbital elements into vectors.

There is a lot still to do:

* Reference frame transformations.
* Propagation of orbits.
* Verification of algorithms.
* Benchmarking
* Documentation
